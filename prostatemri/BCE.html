		Post-treatment prostate MRI is not part of PI-RADS.
		<br><br>
		DCE (Dynamic Contrast Enhancement) is the dominate sequence.  
		<br><br>
		DCE is considered positive when the enhancement is early.  Early is within 10 seconds of the femoral artery or earlier than the rest of the prostate.
		<br><br>
		Sites of early contrast enhancement are the potential sites of local recurrance.
		<br><br>
		DWI is the next most important sequence particularly if the patient cannot have IV Gadolinium.
		<br><br>
		The most likely areas for locally recurrrent disease are:
		<ol>
			<li>Peri-anastomotic</li>
			<li>Bladder neck</li>
			<li>Seminal Vessicle Bed</li>
		</ol>
