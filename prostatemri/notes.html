-->
		PI-RADS grade is based on the most suspicious lesion.
		<br><br>
		Grade at most 4 lesions.
		<br><br>
		Prostate volume = Length * Width * Hieght * 0.52
		<br><br>
		If the patient has had a recent biopsy areas of hemorrhage will simulate cancer on T2 as well as DWI/ADC.
		<br><br>
		Use T1 images to help define the areas of biopsy related hemorrhage.
		<br><br>
		Pelvic lymph nodes should be described but are neither sensitive nor specific.  8mm short axis nodes are felt to be specific.
