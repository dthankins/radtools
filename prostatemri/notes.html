		<h1>Prostate MRI Notes </h1>

		For now, this is just the notes I am using to finish the App.  Later, I will keep some general notes here.
		<br><br>
		Prostate volume = Length * Width * Hieght * 0.52
		<br><br>
		If the patient has had a recent biopsy areas of hemorrhage will simulate cancer on T2 as well as DWI/ADC.
		<br><br>
		Use T1 images to help define the areas of biopsy related hemorrhage.
		<br><br>
		Pelvic lymph nodes should be described but are niether sensitive or specific.  8mm short axis nodes are felt to be specific.
		<br><br>
		

		
		Add pics: each Score, anatomy Nv bundle, anatomy Central Zone, anatomy AFMS, sv sclerosis or collapse

		central zone is an anatomic region located at the base of the prostate gland, with a symmetric appearance on either side of the ejaculatory ducts (Fig 14). Because of its rich stromal component, the central zone dem- onstrates low signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images and restricted diffusion and thus may be confused with cancer (40). In addition, because prostatitis can show abnormal signal intensity with all pulse sequences, it should be emphasized that ndings that are indistinct, linear, lobar, or diffuse in nature, rather than having discrete margins, usually are also benign (Fig 15).
